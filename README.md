# Custom Data Structures in Java

This project demonstrates the implementation of *Custom Stack* and *Custom List* in Java without relying on built-in Stack or ArrayList classes.  
An *Implementation* class provides a simple console menu for interacting with both data structures.

## 🛠 Features

### 🔹 CustomStack
- Push an element  - O(1)
- Pop an element  - O(1)
- Peek the top element  - O(1)
- search for an eleemnt - O(n)
- Find Size - O(1) 

### 🔹 CustomArrayList
- Add elements dynamically (auto-resizing array)  - O(1)
- Get element at index  - O(n)
- Remove element at index (with shifting)  - O(n)
- Get current size  - O(1)

## ▶ How to Run

1. Clone or download this project.  
2. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java).  
3. Make sure the `Tasks` package structure is correct.  
4. Compile and run the *Implementation* class:

```bash
javac Tasks/*.java
java Tasks.Implementation

✅ If you choose Custom List
You’ll first add elements.
Then you can optionally remove an element by index.
The list resizes automatically when full.


📖 Learning Outcomes
Implementing custom stack using arrays.
Creating a generic list with dynamic resizing.
Designing a menu-driven console app.
Understanding encapsulation and modularization in Java.
